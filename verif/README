Verification directory

All tests should run from the Makefile.  The goal is to be able to run
all the regression tests in an automated manner from a single place.
If a test fails the makefile should stop and report at least the last
step.  A makefile and a vcd (waves) file should be left behind for
post mortem.

The top level test groups are

    regress   - basic verilog regressions with local verilog test benches
    diags     - pdp11 diagnostic code of verious flavors
    bootrt11  - boot rt11 from a simulated ide disk

The regressions are pretty simple and just verify basic functionality.  The
will catch major breaks in functionality.

The diags are a mixture of simple pdp-11 code I wrote to test simple cases
and actual diagnostics from DEC.

Booting RT11 is a somewhat high level but does test pretty much
everything except the MMU.
